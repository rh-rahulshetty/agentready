### 2.2 Inline Documentation (Docstrings/Comments)

**Definition:** Function, class, and module-level documentation using language-specific conventions (Python docstrings, JSDoc/TSDoc).

**Why It Matters:** Type hints significantly improve LLM experience. Well-typed code directs LLMs into latent space regions corresponding to higher code quality—similar to how LaTeX-formatted math problems get better results.

**Impact on Agent Behavior:**
- Understanding function purpose without reading implementation
- Better parameter validation suggestions
- More accurate return type predictions
- Improved test generation
- Enhanced refactoring confidence

**Measurable Criteria:**
- All public functions/methods have docstrings
- Docstrings include: description, parameters, return values, exceptions, examples
- Python: PEP 257 compliant
- JavaScript/TypeScript: JSDoc or TSDoc
- Coverage: >80% of public API documented
- Tools: pydocstyle, documentation-js

**Citations:**
- Medium: "LLM Coding Concepts: Static Typing, Structured Output, and AsyncIO"
- ArXiv: "TypyBench: Evaluating LLM Type Inference for Untyped Python Repositories"
- TypeScript Documentation: JSDoc Reference

**Example:**
```python
# Good: Comprehensive docstring
def calculate_discount(price: float, discount_percent: float) -> float:
    """
    Calculate discounted price.

    Args:
        price: Original price in USD
        discount_percent: Discount percentage (0-100)

    Returns:
        Discounted price

    Raises:
        ValueError: If discount_percent not in 0-100 range

    Example:
        >>> calculate_discount(100.0, 20.0)
        80.0
    """
    if not 0 <= discount_percent <= 100:
        raise ValueError("Discount must be 0-100")
    return price * (1 - discount_percent / 100)

# Bad: No documentation
def calc_disc(p, d):
    return p * (1 - d / 100)
```

---

### 2.3 Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

**Definition:** Lightweight documents capturing architectural decisions with context, decision, and consequences.

**Why It Matters:** ADRs provide historical context for "why" decisions were made. When AI encounters patterns or constraints, ADRs explain rationale, preventing counter-productive suggestions.

**Impact on Agent Behavior:**
- Understanding project evolution and design philosophy
- Avoiding proposing previously rejected alternatives
- Aligning suggestions with established architectural principles
- Better context for refactoring recommendations

**Measurable Criteria:**
- Store in `docs/adr/` or `.adr/` directory
- Use consistent template (Michael Nygard or MADR)
- Each ADR includes: Title, Status, Context, Decision, Consequences
- Status values: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded
- One decision per ADR
- Sequential numbering (ADR-001, ADR-002...)

**Citations:**
- AWS Prescriptive Guidance: "ADR process"
- GitHub: joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record
- Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework

**Template:**
```markdown
# ADR-001: Use PostgreSQL for Primary Database

Status: Accepted

## Context
Need persistent storage supporting ACID transactions, complex queries, and JSON data.

## Decision
Use PostgreSQL 14+ as primary database.

## Consequences
Positive:
- Strong ACID guarantees

- JSON support via jsonb

Negative:
- More operational complexity than managed NoSQL
- Requires schema migration planning
- Horizontal scaling more complex
```

---

## 3. CODE QUALITY METRICS

### 3.1 Cyclomatic Complexity Thresholds

**Definition:** Measurement of linearly independent paths through code, indicating decision point density.

**Why It Matters:** High cyclomatic complexity confuses both humans and AI. While not perfect (doesn't capture cognitive complexity), it correlates strongly with testing difficulty and error potential.

**Impact on Agent Behavior:**
- Functions with complexity >25 are harder to understand
- Reduced confidence in safe modifications
- More difficult to generate comprehensive tests
- Increased likelihood of introducing bugs during refactoring

**Measurable Criteria:**
- Target: Cyclomatic complexity <10 per function
- Warning threshold: 15
- Error threshold: 25
- Tools: clang-tidy (C++), radon (Python), complexity-report (JavaScript), gocyclo (Go)

**Citations:**
- Microsoft Learn: "Code metrics - Cyclomatic complexity"
- Checkstyle Documentation

---

### 3.2 Function/Method Length Limits

**Definition:** Keeping functions/methods small (typically <50 lines, ideally <20).

**Why It Matters:** Working memory handles ~4 objects simultaneously. Long functions exceed cognitive capacity. Research on reading comprehension shows lines >50-75 characters reduce comprehension; code has higher cognitive load per line.

**Impact on Agent Behavior:**
- Easier holistic function understanding
- Better isolation for testing
- Safer modifications without unintended side effects
- Clearer single responsibility principle adherence

**Measurable Criteria:**
- Target: <20 lines per function
- Warning: 50 lines

---

### 3.3 Type Annotations (Static Typing)

**Definition:** Explicit type declarations for variables, parameters, and return values.

**Why It Matters:** Type hints significantly improve LLM code understanding. Higher-quality codebases have type annotations, directing LLMs toward higher-quality latent space regions. Creates synergistic improvement: LLMs generate better typed code, which helps future LLM interactions.

**Impact on Agent Behavior:**
- Better input validation
- Type error detection before execution
- Structured output generation
- Improved autocomplete suggestions
- Enhanced refactoring safety

**Measurable Criteria:**
- Python: All public functions have parameter and return type hints
- TypeScript: `strict` mode enabled in tsconfig.json
- Go: Inherently typed
- Coverage: >80% of functions typed
- Tools: mypy (Python), pyright (Python), tsc --strict (TypeScript)

**Citations:**
- Medium: "LLM Coding Concepts: Static Typing, Structured Output"
- ArXiv: "Automated Type Annotation in Python Using LLMs"
- Dropbox Tech Blog: "Our journey to type checking 4 million lines of Python"

**Example:**
```python
# Good: Full type annotations
from typing import List, Optional

def find_users(
    role: str,
    active: bool = True,
    limit: Optional[int] = None
) -> List[User]:
    """Find users matching criteria."""
    query = User.query.filter_by(role=role, active=active)
    if limit:
        query = query.limit(limit)
    return query.all()

# Bad: No type hints
def find_users(role, active=True, limit=None):
    query = User.query.filter_by(role=role, active=active)
    if limit:
        query = query.limit(limit)
    return query.all()
```

### 3.4 Code Smell Elimination

**Definition:** Removing indicators of deeper problems: long methods, large classes, duplicate code, dead code, magic numbers.

**Why It Matters:** Research shows AI-generated code increases "code churn" (copy/paste vs. refactoring) and DRY principle violations. Clean baseline prevents AI from perpetuating anti-patterns.

**Impact on Agent Behavior:**
- Better intent understanding
- More accurate refactoring suggestions
- Avoidance of anti-pattern propagation
- Improved code quality over time

**Measurable Criteria:**
- Tools: SonarQube, PMD, Checkstyle, pylint, eslint

│       ├── __init__.py
│       └── module.py
├── tests/
├── docs/
├── README.md
├── pyproject.toml
└── requirements.txt
```

**Go:**
```
project/
├── cmd/           # Main applications
│   └── app/
│       └── main.go
├── internal/      # Private code
├── pkg/           # Public libraries
├── go.mod
└── go.sum
```

**JavaScript/TypeScript (Node.js):**
```
project/
├── src/
├── test/
├── dist/
├── package.json
├── package-lock.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

**Impact on Agent Behavior:**
- Targeted modifications without affecting unrelated code
- Better refactoring suggestions
- Clearer module purpose understanding
- Reduced side effect risk

**Measurable Criteria:**
- Each module/class has one reason to change
- High cohesion within modules (related functions together)
- Low coupling between modules (minimal dependencies)
- Organize by feature/domain, not technical layer (avoid separate "controllers", "services", "models" directories)

**Citations:**
- Wikipedia: "Separation of concerns"
- DevIQ: "Separation of Concerns"
- Medium: "Single responsibility and Separation of concerns principles"

---

## 5. TESTING & CI/CD

### 5.1 Test Coverage Requirements

**Definition:** Percentage of code executed by automated tests.

**Why It Matters:** High test coverage enables confident AI modifications. Research shows AI tools (Cursor AI) can cut test coverage time by 85% while maintaining quality—but only when good tests exist as foundation.

**Impact on Agent Behavior:**

---

### 5.2 Test Naming Conventions

**Definition:** Descriptive test names following patterns like `test_should_<expected>_when_<condition>`.

**Why It Matters:** Clear test names help AI understand intent without reading implementation. When tests fail, AI diagnoses issues faster with self-documenting names.

**Impact on Agent Behavior:**
- Generation of similar test patterns
- Faster edge case understanding
- More accurate fix proposals aligned with intent
- Better test coverage gap identification

**Measurable Criteria:**
- Pattern: `test_<method>_<scenario>_<expected_outcome>`
- Example: `test_create_user_with_invalid_email_raises_value_error`
- Avoid: `test1`, `test_edge_case`, `test_bug_fix`, `test_method_name`
- Test names should be readable as sentences

**Citations:**
- pytest documentation: Test naming best practices
- JUnit best practices
- Go testing conventions

**Example:**
```python
# Good: Self-documenting test names
def test_create_user_with_valid_data_returns_user_instance():
    user = create_user(email="test@example.com", name="Test")
    assert isinstance(user, User)

def test_create_user_with_invalid_email_raises_value_error():
    with pytest.raises(ValueError, match="Invalid email"):
        create_user(email="not-an-email", name="Test")

def test_create_user_with_duplicate_email_raises_integrity_error():
    create_user(email="test@example.com", name="Test 1")
    with pytest.raises(IntegrityError):
        create_user(email="test@example.com", name="Test 2")

# Bad: Unclear test names
def test_user1():
    user = create_user(email="test@example.com", name="Test")
    assert user

def test_user2():
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        create_user(email="invalid", name="Test")
```

---

### 5.3 Pre-commit Hooks & CI/CD Linting

**Definition:** Automated code quality checks before commits (pre-commit hooks) and in CI/CD pipeline.

**Why It Matters:** Pre-commit hooks provide immediate feedback but can be bypassed. Running same checks in CI/CD ensures enforcement. Linting errors prevent successful CI runs, wasting time and compute.

**Impact on Agent Behavior:**
- Ensures AI-generated code meets quality standards
- Immediate feedback loop for improvements
- Consistent code style across all contributions
- Prevents low-quality code from entering repository

**Measurable Criteria:**
- Pre-commit framework installed and configured

  - Formatters: black/autopep8 (Python), prettier (JS/TS), gofmt (Go)
  - Linters: flake8/pylint (Python), eslint (JS/TS), golint (Go)
  - Type checkers: mypy/pyright (Python), tsc (TypeScript)
- **Critical:** Same checks run in CI/CD (non-skippable)
- CI fails on any linting error
- Fast execution: <30 seconds total

**Citations:**
- Memfault Blog: "Automatically format and lint code with pre-commit"
- Medium: "Elevate Your CI: Mastering Pre-commit Hooks and GitHub Actions"

**Impact on Agent Behavior:**
- Generates properly formatted commit messages
- Understands which changes are breaking
- Appropriate version bump suggestions
- Better git history comprehension
- Automated changelog contribution

**Measurable Criteria:**
- Format: `type(scope): description`
- **Types:** feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, chore, build, ci
- **Breaking changes:** `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer or `!` after type
- **Tools:** commitlint, commitizen, semantic-release
- **Enforcement:** Pre-commit hook or CI check
- All commits follow convention (enforce in CI)

**Citations:**
- Conventional Commits specification v1.0.0
- Medium: "GIT — Semantic versioning and conventional commits"
- CMU SEI Blog: "Versioning with Git Tags and Conventional Commits"

changes
wip
asdf
```

---

### 7.2 .gitignore Completeness

**Definition:** Comprehensive .gitignore preventing sensitive files, build artifacts, and environment-specific files from version control.

**Why It Matters:** Incomplete .gitignore pollutes repository with irrelevant files, consuming context window space and creating security risks (accidentally committing .env files, credentials).

**Impact on Agent Behavior:**
- Focus on source code, not build artifacts
- Security files excluded prevent accidental exposure
- Cleaner repository navigation

### 9.2 Structured Logging

**Definition:** Logging in structured format (JSON) with consistent field names and types.

**Why It Matters:** Structured logs are machine-parseable. AI can analyze logs to diagnose issues, identify patterns, suggest optimizations, and correlate events across distributed systems.

**Impact on Agent Behavior:**
- Log query and analysis capabilities
- Event correlation across services
- Pattern identification for debugging
- Data-driven optimization suggestions
- Anomaly detection

**Measurable Criteria:**
- Use structured logging library: structlog (Python), winston (Node.js), zap (Go)
- **Standard fields across all logs:**
  - timestamp (ISO 8601 format)
  - level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
  - message (human-readable)
  - context: request_id, user_id, session_id, trace_id
- Consistent naming convention (snake_case or camelCase, not both)
- Log levels used appropriately
- **Never log sensitive data:** passwords, tokens, credit cards, PII (without anonymization)
- JSON format for production

**Citations:**
- Daily.dev: "12 Logging Best Practices: Do's & Don'ts"
- Dataset Blog: "Logging Best Practices: The 13 You Should Know"
- Technogise Medium: "Logging Practices: Guidelines for Developers"

**Example:**
```python
# Good: Structured logging
import structlog

logger = structlog.get_logger()

logger.info(
    "user_login_success",
    user_id="user_123",
    request_id="req_abc",
    duration_ms=45,
    ip_address="192.168.1.1"
)

# Output:
# {"timestamp": "2025-01-20T10:30:00Z", "level": "info", "event": "user_login_success",
#  "user_id": "user_123", "request_id": "req_abc", "duration_ms": 45, "ip_address": "192.168.1.1"}

# Bad: Unstructured logging
print("User user_123 logged in from 192.168.1.1 in 45ms")
```

## 10. API & INTERFACE DOCUMENTATION

### 10.1 OpenAPI/Swagger Specifications

**Definition:** Machine-readable API documentation in OpenAPI format (formerly Swagger).

**Why It Matters:** OpenAPI specs define everything needed to integrate with an API: authentication, endpoints, HTTP methods, request/response schemas, error codes. AI can read specs to generate client code, tests, and integration code automatically.

**Impact on Agent Behavior:**
- Auto-generation of SDKs and client libraries
- Request/response validation
- API mocking for testing
- Contract compliance verification
- Interactive API exploration

**Measurable Criteria:**
- OpenAPI 3.0+ specification file (openapi.yaml or openapi.json)
- **All endpoints documented with:**
  - Description and purpose
  - HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH)
  - Parameters (path, query, header)
  - Request body schema
  - Response schemas (success and error cases)
  - Authentication requirements
  - Example requests/responses
- Validation: Use Swagger Editor or Spectral
- Auto-generate from code annotations OR keep manually in sync
- Hosted documentation (Swagger UI, ReDoc)

**Citations:**
- Swagger Blog: "API Documentation Best Practices"
- APItoolkit: "OpenAPI Specification for API Development"
- APImatic: "14 Best Practices to Write OpenAPI for Better API Consumption"

**Example:**
```yaml
# Good: Comprehensive OpenAPI spec
openapi: 3.0.0
info:
  title: User API
  version: 1.0.0
paths:
  /users/{userId}:
    get:
      summary: Get user by ID
      parameters:
        - name: userId
          in: path
          required: true
          schema:
            type: string
      responses:
        '200':
          description: User found
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/User'
        '404':
          description: User not found
components:
  schemas:
    User:
      type: object
      required:
        - id
        - email
      properties:
        id:
          type: string
        email:
          type: string
          format: email
        name:
          type: string
```

### 10.2 GraphQL Schemas

**Definition:** Type definitions for GraphQL APIs using Schema Definition Language (SDL).

**Why It Matters:** GraphQL schemas are self-documenting and introspectable. AI can understand available queries, mutations, types, and relationships without exploring implementation code.

**Impact on Agent Behavior:**
- Generate type-safe queries
- Schema validation
- Performance optimization suggestions (N+1 query detection)
- Type-safe client generation
- API evolution guidance

**Measurable Criteria:**
- schema.graphql file in repository
- All types, queries, mutations include descriptions
- Use directives for:
  - Deprecation (@deprecated)
  - Authorization (@auth)
  - Field resolution hints
- Schema validation in CI/CD
- SDL-first approach (schema-first, not code-first)

**Citations:**
- GraphQL documentation: "Schema Definition Language"
- Apollo GraphQL: "Schema design best practices"
- Hasura GraphQL best practices

**Example:**
```graphql
# Good: Well-documented GraphQL schema
"""
Represents a user in the system
"""
type User {
  """
  Unique identifier for the user
  """
  id: ID!

  """
  User's email address (unique)
  """
  email: String!

  """
  User's display name
  """
  name: String

  """
  Posts created by this user
  """
  posts: [Post!]!
}

type Query {
  """
  Find a user by their unique ID
  """
  user(id: ID!): User

  """
  List all users with optional filtering
  """
  users(role: String, active: Boolean): [User!]!
}
```

## 11. MODULARITY & CODE ORGANIZATION

### 11.1 DRY Principle (Don't Repeat Yourself)

**Definition:** Every piece of knowledge has single, authoritative representation in the system.

**Why It Matters:** Research shows AI-generated code increases code churn and DRY violations (copy-paste instead of refactoring). Enforcing DRY in codebase teaches AI to refactor rather than duplicate.

**Impact on Agent Behavior:**
- Learns to extract shared logic
- Suggests refactorings instead of duplication
- Avoids creating duplicate implementations
- Better abstraction identification

**Measurable Criteria:**
- "Three Strikes" rule: Third duplicate occurrence triggers refactoring
- Tools detect duplication: SonarQube, PMD (Java), jscpd (JavaScript), pylint (Python)
- Shared logic extracted to:
  - Utility functions/modules
  - Base classes
  - Mixins/traits
  - Libraries
- **Balance:** Avoid premature abstraction ("prefer duplication over wrong abstraction")
- Target: <5% duplicate code

**Citations:**
- Wikipedia: "Don't repeat yourself"
- The Pragmatic Programmer by Hunt & Thomas
- Medium: "The DRY Principle and Incidental Duplication"
- Sandi Metz: "The Wrong Abstraction"

---

### 11.2 Consistent Naming Conventions

**Definition:** Systematic naming patterns for variables, functions, classes, files following language/framework conventions.

**Why It Matters:** Research shows identifier style affects recall and precision. Consistency reduces cognitive load. AI models recognize naming patterns from training on open-source code.

**Impact on Agent Behavior:**
- Accurate intent inference
- Appropriate name suggestions
- Code structure understanding
- Pattern recognition

**Measurable Criteria:**
- Follow language conventions:
  - **Python:** PEP 8 (snake_case functions, PascalCase classes, UPPER_CASE constants)
  - **JavaScript/TypeScript:** camelCase functions/variables, PascalCase classes
  - **Go:** mixedCaps (exported: UpperCase, unexported: lowerCase)
  - **Java:** camelCase methods, PascalCase classes, UPPER_CASE constants
- Use paired opposites consistently: add/remove, start/stop, begin/end, open/close
- Avoid abbreviations unless widely understood (HTTP, API, URL, ID)
- Enforce via linters: pylint, eslint, golint

**Citations:**
- Wikipedia: "Naming convention (programming)"
- Microsoft Learn: "General Naming Conventions"
- PEP 8 - Style Guide for Python Code
- Google Style Guides (Java, Python, JavaScript, Go)

**Example:**
```python
# Good: Consistent naming
class UserService:
    MAX_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS = 5

    def create_user(self, email: str) -> User:
        """Create new user."""
        pass

    def delete_user(self, user_id: str) -> None:
        """Delete existing user."""
        pass

# Bad: Inconsistent naming
class userservice:
    maxLoginAttempts = 5

    def CreateUser(self, e: str) -> User:
        pass

    def removeUser(self, uid: str) -> None:
        pass
```

---

### 11.3 Semantic File & Directory Naming

**Definition:** File names and directory structures that convey purpose and content clearly.

**Why It Matters:** Semantic organization helps AI locate relevant code quickly. Clear names reduce cognitive overhead and enable predictable file location.

**Impact on Agent Behavior:**
- Faster relevant file location
- Accurate placement suggestions for new code
- Better repository organization understanding
- Reduced search time

**Measurable Criteria:**
- **Feature-based organization:** Group related files by feature/domain, not technical layer
- **Clear, descriptive names:** `user_service.py` not `us.py`
- **Avoid abbreviations** unless standard in domain
- **Mirror test structure** to source structure:
  - `src/services/user_service.py` → `tests/services/test_user_service.py`
- **Consistent file extensions:** .py, .js, .ts, .go
- **Module files:** `__init__.py`, index.js for package entry points

**Citations:**
- GitHub: kriasoft/Folder-Structure-Conventions
- Iterators: "Comprehensive Guide on Project Codebase Organization"
- Medium: "A Front-End Application Folder Structure that Makes Sense"

**Example:**
```
# Good: Feature-based, semantic organization
src/
├── auth/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── login_service.py
│   ├── oauth_provider.py
│   └── session_manager.py
├── users/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── user_model.py
│   ├── user_service.py
│   └── user_repository.py
└── billing/
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── payment_processor.py
    └── invoice_generator.py

# Bad: Technical layer organization, unclear names
src/
├── models/
│   ├── u.py
│   └── o.py
├── services/
│   ├── svc1.py
│   └── svc2.py
└── utils/
    └── helpers.py
```

- Better understanding of deployment process

**Measurable Criteria:**
- CI config file in repository:
  - GitHub Actions: `.github/workflows/`
  - GitLab CI: `.gitlab-ci.yml`
  - CircleCI: `.circleci/config.yml`
- **Clear job/step names** (not "step1", "step2")
- **Comments explaining complex logic**
- **Fast feedback:** Tests complete <10 minutes
- **Fail fast:** Stop on first failure to save compute
- **Parallelization:** Run independent jobs concurrently
- **Caching:** Dependencies, build artifacts
- **Artifacts:** Test results, coverage reports, logs

**Citations:**
- CircleCI: "Monorepo dev practices"
- GitHub Actions documentation
- GitLab CI best practices
- Martin Fowler: "Continuous Integration"

---

### 12.2 Branch Protection & Status Checks

- Awareness of quality gates
- Suggestions aligned with branch policies
- Better PR creation (ensuring checks pass)

**Measurable Criteria:**
- Branch protection enabled for main/master/production
- **Required status checks:**
  - All tests passing
  - Linting/formatting passing
  - Code coverage threshold met
  - Security scanning passing
- **Required reviews:** At least 1 approval
- **No force pushes** to protected branches
- **No direct commits** to protected branches
- **Up-to-date branch** requirement (rebase/merge before merging)

**Citations:**
- GitHub Docs: "About protected branches"
- GitLab: "Protected branches"
- Industry best practices

---

## 13. SECURITY & COMPLIANCE

### 13.1 Security Scanning Automation

**Definition:** Automated security scans for vulnerabilities, secrets, and compliance issues in CI/CD.

**Why It Matters:** AI can accidentally introduce vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, etc.). Research shows LLM-generated code has security weaknesses, particularly around outdated practices. Automated scanning provides safety net.

**Impact on Agent Behavior:**
- Security pattern learning
- Vulnerability avoidance
- Secure coding practice adoption
- Failed scans provide improvement feedback

**Measurable Criteria:**
- **Dependency scanning:** Snyk, Dependabot, npm audit, safety (Python)
- **Secret scanning:** GitLeaks, TruffleHog, detect-secrets
- **Static analysis:** Semgrep, CodeQL, Bandit (Python), gosec (Go)
- **Scans run on:**
  - Every PR (pre-merge)
  - Every commit to main
  - Scheduled (weekly/nightly)
- **Zero tolerance:** No high/critical vulnerabilities allowed to merge
- **SLA:** High severity vulnerabilities fixed within 7 days

**Citations:**
- ArXiv: "Security and Quality in LLM-Generated Code"
- ArXiv: "Security Degradation in Iterative AI Code Generation"
- GitHub Advanced Security documentation
- OWASP Top 10

---

### 13.2 Secrets Management

**Definition:** Proper handling of sensitive data (API keys, passwords, tokens) using secret management tools, not hardcoded values.

**Why It Matters:** Hardcoded secrets in code create security vulnerabilities. AI might accidentally suggest or expose secrets. Proper secrets management is critical security practice.

**Impact on Agent Behavior:**
- Avoids suggesting hardcoded secrets
- Recommends environment variables
- Identifies potential secret exposure
- Suggests secure alternatives

**Measurable Criteria:**
- **No secrets in code:** Use environment variables, secret managers
- **Tools:**
  - Development: .env files (not committed), direnv
  - Production: HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, GCP Secret Manager
- **.env.example** committed (without real values)
- **.env** in .gitignore
- **Secret rotation** documented and automated
- **Pre-commit hook:** Detect-secrets or similar

**Citations:**
- OWASP: "Secrets Management Cheat Sheet"
- GitHub: "Removing sensitive data from a repository"
- HashiCorp Vault documentation

---

## 14. DOCUMENTATION PHILOSOPHY

### 14.1 "Why, Not What" Comments

**Definition:** Comments explain rationale and context, not behavior (which code already shows).

**Why It Matters:** AI can read code to understand "what" it does. Comments providing "why" give context for decisions, workarounds, constraints, and edge cases that aren't obvious from code alone.

**Impact on Agent Behavior:**
- Understanding of constraints and limitations
- Avoidance of "obvious" refactorings that break assumptions
- Preservation of original intent during modifications
- Better context for debugging and optimization

**Measurable Criteria:**
- **Comments explain:**
  - Why this approach was chosen (vs. alternatives)
  - Edge cases and gotchas
  - Performance considerations
  - Historical context (why workaround exists)
  - TODOs with context and rationale
- **Avoid:**
  - Redundant comments duplicating code
  - Commented-out code (use version control)
  - Obvious statements
- **Keep comments in sync** with code during changes

**Citations:**
- Stack Overflow Blog: "Best practices for writing code comments"
- Stepsize: "The Engineer's Guide to Writing Meaningful Code Comments"
- Boot.dev: "Best Practices for Commenting Code"

**Example:**
```python
# Good: Explains "why"
# Using binary search instead of hash table because dataset is
# read-once and memory-constrained (< 100MB available).
# Hash table would require 150MB for this dataset size.
result = binary_search(sorted_data, target)

# API returns 202 Accepted for async processing, but we need
# synchronous behavior for consistency. Poll until completion.
response = api.start_job()
while response.status == 202:
    time.sleep(1)
    response = api.check_status(response.job_id)

# Bad: Redundant, explains "what"
# Search for target in sorted_data
result = binary_search(sorted_data, target)

# Call the API
response = api.start_job()
```

---

## 15. PERFORMANCE & OBSERVABILITY

### 15.1 Performance Benchmarks

**Definition:** Automated performance tests tracking metrics like response time, throughput, memory usage.

**Why It Matters:** Performance regressions can slip in unnoticed. Benchmarks provide objective measurements. AI can suggest optimizations based on benchmark results.

**Impact on Agent Behavior:**
- Performance-aware optimization suggestions
- Regression detection
- Data-driven refactoring decisions
- Bottleneck identification

**Measurable Criteria:**
- Benchmark suite in repository
- **Tools:** pytest-benchmark (Python), Benchmark.js (JavaScript), testing.B (Go)
- Run benchmarks in CI for critical paths
- Track metrics over time
- Alert on regressions (>10% slowdown)

**Citations:**
- Google: "Benchmarking Best Practices"
- Python performance benchmarking docs
- Go benchmarking documentation
