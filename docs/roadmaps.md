## Executive Summary

AgentReady can evolve along three strategic paths, each building on our core strength: **systematically making codebases more effective for AI-assisted development**.

### The Three Roadmaps

| Roadmap | Vision | Timeline | Strategic Impact |
|---------|--------|----------|------------------|
| **🏅 Compliance Engine** | Quality gate for AI tools | 6-8 weeks | Adoption velocity via enforcement |
| **🤖 Agent Coach** | AI-powered remediation | 8-10 weeks | Retention via assistance |
| **🧠 Intelligence Layer** | Codebase understanding platform | 10-12 weeks | Platform moat |

### Recommended Path

**Start with Roadmap 1, then evolve:**

- **Months 1-2**: Implement compliance features → fastest path to adoption
- **Months 3-4**: Layer in AI-powered fixes → convert enforcement to assistance
- **Months 5-6**: Build out API/platform → leverage data from mature deployment

This progression maximizes **adoption velocity** (enforcement), **retention** (AI assistance), and **strategic positioning** (platform moat).

## Roadmap 1: The Compliance Engine

**Agent-Ready Certification as Quality Gate**

### Vision

Make AgentReady a required quality gate for Red Hat's AI-assisted development. Repositories must hit **Silver (60+)** to use AI tools, **Gold (75+)** for production deployments.

**Strategic Value**: Immediate adoption through mandate, establishes AgentReady as standard across Red Hat engineering.

### Timeline

**6-8 weeks** from v1.0 to production-ready compliance system

### Core Features

#### 1. GitHub Actions Integration

- **PR status checks** with pass/fail based on score threshold
- **Automated PR comments** with assessment summary and trend analysis
- **Custom certification levels** per team/product (override default thresholds)
- **Workflow templates** for easy adoption

#### 2. Organization Dashboard

- **Leaderboard** showing all repositories with scores and certification levels
- **Trend tracking** over time (score improvements, regression detection)
- **Team rollups** aggregating scores by team/product
- **Executive reporting** with high-level metrics and health indicators

#### 3. Automated Remediation (`agentready align`)

- **Template-based fixes** for common issues (missing files, standard configs)
- **One-click remediation** from HTML reports
- **Batch operations** to fix multiple issues at once
- **Preview mode** showing what will change before applying

#### 4. Interactive Reports

- **"Fix This" buttons** in HTML reports triggering automated remediation

## Recommended Approach

### Why Sequential Execution?

**Start with Roadmap 1, then layer in 2 and 3:**

#### Months 1-2: Compliance Engine

- **Fastest path to adoption** via executive mandate
- **Establishes baseline** for all repositories
- **Generates data** for AI training and pattern detection
- **Proves value** with concrete metrics (adoption, score improvements)

#### Months 3-4: Agent Coach

- **Converts enforcement to assistance** (carrot after stick)
- **Improves developer experience** dramatically
- **Increases engagement** (from compliance to eager usage)
- **Builds trust** in AI-generated fixes

#### Months 5-6: Intelligence Layer

- **Leverages mature deployment** (100+ repos with rich data)
- **Enables cross-product synergies** (RHOAI, RHEL AI, etc.)
- **Creates platform moat** (hard to replicate data advantage)
- **Opens revenue opportunities** (external partnerships, SaaS)

### Why NOT Parallel Development?

**Parallel development risks:**

- **Resource constraints**: Stretching team too thin reduces quality
- **Integration complexity**: Features designed independently may not mesh well
- **Data dependency**: Roadmap 3 needs data from Roadmap 1 deployment
- **Market feedback**: Each phase informs next (pilot learnings, usage patterns)

### Success Checkpoints

**Proceed to next roadmap only if:**

| Checkpoint | Criteria |
|------------|----------|
| **Roadmap 1 → 2** | 50+ repos at Silver, 80% pilot satisfaction, <5% regression rate |
| **Roadmap 2 → 3** | 75% AI fix acceptance, 200+ repos using coach, 10+ teams with auto-PRs |
| **Roadmap 3 → External** | 5+ internal integrations, 10K+ API calls/day, 95% uptime |
