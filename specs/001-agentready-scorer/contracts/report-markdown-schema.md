### 3. Detailed Findings (REQUIRED)

For each category, include subsection with all attributes:

```markdown
## Detailed Findings

### 1. Context Window Optimization

#### 1.1 CLAUDE.md Configuration Files ✅

**Tier**: 1 (Essential)
**Score**: 100/100
**Status**: Pass

**Measured**: File exists (487 lines)
**Threshold**: <1000 lines with required sections

**Evidence**:
- ✅ File exists: `CLAUDE.md`
- ✅ File size: 487 lines (under 1000 line limit)
- ✅ Contains tech stack section
- ✅ Contains standard commands section

<details>
<summary>🔧 Good Practices Found</summary>

- Concise format optimized for Claude context window
- Clear repository structure documentation
- Explicit security/compliance notes included
</details>

---

#### 1.2 Concise Structured Documentation ⚠️

**Tier**: 1 (Essential)
**Score**: 60/100
**Status**: Needs Improvement

**Measured**: README 1247 lines
**Threshold**: <500 lines

**Evidence**:
- ⚠️ README exists but exceeds recommended size: `README.md` (1247 lines)
- ✅ Uses standard Markdown headings
- ⚠️ Missing table of contents for >100 line document

<details>
<summary>🔧 Remediation Steps</summary>

**Summary**: Split README into smaller, focused documents

**Steps**:
1. Identify sections that could be separate documents (API docs, architecture, deployment)
2. Create `docs/` directory for detailed documentation
3. Keep README focused on quickstart and overview
4. Add links to detailed docs from README
5. Add table of contents to README

**Tools Needed**:
- None (manual refactoring)

**Commands**:
```bash
mkdir -p docs/
# Move detailed sections to docs/api.md, docs/architecture.md, etc.
```

**References**:
- [Real Python: Documentation Best Practices](https://realpython.com/documenting-python-code/)
- [GitHub README Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes)

</details>

---
```

**Requirements for Each Attribute**:
- Level 4 heading (`####`) with attribute number, name, and status emoji
- Bold labels for Tier, Score, Status, Measured, Threshold
- Tier number with description (e.g., "1 (Essential)")
- Status: "Pass", "Fail", "Needs Improvement", "Skipped", "Not Applicable"
- Evidence as bulleted list with emoji indicators
- Remediation in `<details>` block (collapsible)
- Remediation includes: Summary, Steps (ordered list), Tools, Commands (code block), References (links)
- Horizontal rule (`---`) between attributes

---

### 4. Certification Level Details (REQUIRED)

```markdown
## Certification Level: Silver (72/100)

Your repository has achieved **Silver** certification. This indicates a solid foundation for agent-ready development, with room for targeted improvements.

**Score Breakdown**:
- **Platinum** (90-100): Exemplary agent-ready codebase
- **Gold** (75-89): Highly optimized for AI-assisted development
- **Silver** (60-74): Well-suited for agent development (YOUR LEVEL)
- **Bronze** (40-59): Basic agent compatibility
- **Needs Improvement** (0-39): Significant optimization needed

**Next Steps to Gold** (need +3 points):
1. Fix README size (1.2 Concise Structured Documentation) - potential +10 points
2. Add pre-commit hooks (5.3 Pre-commit Hooks & CI/CD) - potential +8 points
3. Improve dependency freshness (6.2 Dependency Freshness) - potential +5 points
```

**Requirements**:
- Level 2 heading with certification name and score
- Paragraph explaining certification meaning
- Score breakdown showing all certification levels
- "YOUR LEVEL" marker on current level
- "Next Steps" section with actionable improvements (3-5 items)
