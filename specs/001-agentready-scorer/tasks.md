# Tasks: AgentReady Repository Scorer

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-agentready-scorer/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: NOT REQUESTED - Implementation follows library-first + CLI wrapper pattern per constitution Principle IV

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Single project**: `src/agentready/`, `tests/` at repository root per plan.md

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [X] T001 Create project directory structure matching plan.md (src/agentready/{cli,assessors,models,services,reporters,templates,data})
- [X] T002 Initialize Python project with pyproject.toml including Click, Jinja2, PyYAML, gitpython, radon, lizard, pytest dependencies

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [X] T008 [P] Create Repository model in src/agentready/models/repository.py (path, name, url, branch, commit_hash, languages, total_files, total_lines)
- [X] T009 [P] Create Attribute model in src/agentready/models/attribute.py (id, name, category, tier, description, criteria, default_weight)
- [X] T010 [P] Create Finding model in src/agentready/models/finding.py (attribute, status, score, measured_value, threshold, evidence, remediation, error_message)
- [X] T011 [P] Create Citation model in src/agentready/models/citation.py (source, title, url, relevance)
- [X] T012 [P] Create Remediation model (inline in finding.py) (summary, steps, tools, commands, examples, citations)
- [X] T013 [P] Create Config model in src/agentready/models/config.py (weights, excluded_attributes, language_overrides, output_dir)
- [X] T014 Create Assessment model in src/agentready/models/assessment.py (repository, timestamp, overall_score, certification_level, attributes_assessed, attributes_skipped, attributes_total, findings, config, duration_seconds)
- [X] T015 [P] Create BaseAssessor abstract interface in src/agentready/assessors/base.py with attribute_id, tier, assess(), is_applicable() methods
- [X] T016 [P] Implement LanguageDetector service in src/agentready/services/language_detector.py (file extension mapping, gitignore awareness)
- [X] T017 [P] Implement ResearchLoader service in src/agentready/services/research_loader.py (load bundled report, validate structure, support updates)
- [X] T018 Create Scorer service in src/agentready/services/scorer.py (tier-based weight calculation, certification level determination, score normalization)
- [X] T019 Create Scanner service in src/agentready/services/scanner.py (orchestrate assessment workflow, try-assess-skip error handling, progress tracking)

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User Story 1 (P1): Scoring engine - Can start after Phase 2
  - User Story 2 (P2): HTML reports - Depends on US1 JSON output
  - User Story 3 (P3): Remediation - Depends on US1 findings, enhances US2 HTML
  - User Story 4 (P4): Markdown reports - Depends on US1 JSON output
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: FOUNDATIONAL - Scoring engine required by all other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Consumes US1 JSON output, independently adds HTML generation
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Enhances US1 findings and US2/US4 reports with remediation
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Consumes US1 JSON output, independently adds Markdown generation

### Within Each User Story

- **US1**: Models → Services → Assessors → Scanner → CLI (sequential dependencies)
- **US2**: Template → Reporter → Integration (sequential)
- **US3**: Remediation templates → Assessor integration → Report integration (sequential)
- **US4**: Markdown reporter → Integration (sequential)

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: All tasks [P] can run in parallel (T003-T007)
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: All model creation tasks (T008-T014) can run in parallel, all service tasks (T016-T019) can run in parallel
- **Phase 3 (US1)**: All 13 assessor implementations (T020-T032) can run fully in parallel (different files)
- **Phase 4 (US2)**: Template design (T047-T049) can run in parallel, reporter features (T051-T064) sequential
- **Phase 5 (US3)**: Remediation extraction (T065-T068) can run in parallel
- **Phase 6 (US4)**: Markdown sections (T076-T086) largely parallelizable
- **Phase 7 (Polish)**: Test creation (T090-T093) can run in parallel, documentation (T103-T104) can run in parallel

**Note**: User Story 2 and User Story 4 could potentially be worked on in parallel after US1 completes, as both independently transform US1's JSON output to different formats.

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 Assessors

```bash
# Launch all 13 assessor implementations together:
T020: "Implement DocumentationAssessor in src/agentready/assessors/documentation.py"
T021: "Implement CodeQualityAssessor in src/agentready/assessors/code_quality.py"
T022: "Implement StructureAssessor in src/agentready/assessors/structure.py"
T023: "Implement TestingAssessor in src/agentready/assessors/testing.py"
T024: "Implement DependenciesAssessor in src/agentready/assessors/dependencies.py"
T025: "Implement VCSAssessor in src/agentready/assessors/vcs.py"
T026: "Implement BuildAssessor in src/agentready/assessors/build.py"
T027: "Implement ErrorsAssessor in src/agentready/assessors/errors.py"

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T007)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T008-T019) - CRITICAL
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T020-T046)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Run agentready on test repository, verify JSON output
5. Optionally proceed to US2 (HTML) or US4 (Markdown) for human-readable reports

**Rationale**: US1 alone provides immediate value - repository owners get a comprehensive score with findings. HTML/Markdown reports enhance UX but core assessment functionality works without them.

### Incremental Delivery

1. **Sprint 1**: Setup + Foundational → Can run assessments programmatically
2. **Sprint 2**: User Story 1 → MVP with JSON output + CLI
3. **Sprint 3**: User Story 2 → Add interactive HTML reports
4. **Sprint 4**: User Story 3 → Add actionable remediation guidance
5. **Sprint 5**: User Story 4 → Add version-control-friendly Markdown reports
6. **Sprint 6**: Polish → Testing, optimization, documentation

### Parallel Team Strategy

With 3-4 developers after Foundational phase:

1. **Developer A**: User Story 1 (scoring engine)
2. **Developer B**: User Story 2 (HTML reporter) - starts after US1 JSON structure defined
3. **Developer C**: User Story 4 (Markdown reporter) - starts after US1 JSON structure defined
4. **Developer D**: User Story 3 (remediation) - coordinates with A/B/C to enhance outputs

**Critical Path**: US1 is on critical path (blocks US2/US3/US4). Parallelizing assessor implementations (T020-T032) is key to reducing US1 duration.

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies, safe to parallelize
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story (US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Tests NOT included per constitution (TDD requested but not in spec)
- Each assessor is independently implementable (strategy pattern per research.md)
- Constitution compliance: library-first (assessors/services/models standalone), tool-second (CLI wrapper)
- File paths follow plan.md structure exactly
- Checkpoint after each user story enables incremental validation
- US1 assessors (T020-T032) are largest parallelization opportunity (13 independent files)
